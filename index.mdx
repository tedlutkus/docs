## What You Can Build

Onyx Engine is designed for controls engineers who need AI models that:

- **Predict system dynamics** - Model acceleration, velocity, and position relationships
- **Handle state-space representations** - Define derivative and delta relationships between features
- **Run fast inference** - Deploy models optimized for real-time control loops
- **Simulate trajectories** - Roll out multi-step predictions with automatic state updates

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Data">
    Collect timeseries data from your hardware system with states, outputs, and control inputs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Features">
    Specify which features are model outputs and which are inputs, including state relationships
  </Step>
  <Step title="Train a Model">
    Use the cloud platform to train models with GPU acceleration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Simulate">
    Load your trained model and simulate trajectories for control and analysis
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Example

```python
import onyxengine as onyx
from onyxengine.modeling import Input, Output, MLPConfig, TrainingConfig

# Define model structure
outputs = [Output(name='acceleration')]
inputs = [
    Input(name='velocity', parent='acceleration', relation='derivative'),
    Input(name='position', parent='velocity', relation='derivative'),
    Input(name='control_input'),
]

# Configure and train
model_config = MLPConfig(outputs=outputs, inputs=inputs, dt=0.01)
onyx.train_model(
    model_name='my_model',
    model_config=model_config,
    dataset_name='my_dataset',
)

# Load and simulate
model = onyx.load_model('my_model')
result = model.simulate(
    x0={'velocity': v0, 'position': p0},
    external_inputs={'control_input': u},
    sim_steps=100
)
```
