## When to Use the Platform vs SDK

| Task | Platform | SDK |
|------|----------|-----|
| Upload data | Quick uploads, drag-and-drop | Programmatic uploads, large datasets |
| Configure features | Visual feature selection | Code-defined feature relationships |
| Start training | Simple configurations | Complex configs, automation |
| Monitor progress | Real-time visualizations | Terminal output |
| Compare models | Side-by-side charts | Programmatic analysis |
| Download models | One-click download | `load_model()` |

<Tip>
Use the platform for exploration and visualization, and the SDK for automation and production workflows.

## Platform Layout

### System Overview

The main dashboard shows your complete data lineage:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/node_graph.png" alt="System Overview node graph" />
</Frame>

- **Node Graph**: Interactive visualization of datasets and models
- **Table View**: List of all objects with versions and metadata
- **Lineage Tracking**: See which datasets trained which models

### Navigation

- **Select breadcrumb**: Navigate to specific objects
- **Inspector panel**: Quick view of selected object details
- **Tool palette**: Upload, create, and manage objects

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up** at [engine.onyx-robotics.com](https://engine.onyx-robotics.com)
2. **Explore** the example datasets included with your account
3. **Upload** your own data using the Upload button
4. **Train** a model using the platform or SDK

## Example Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Dataset">
    Drag your CSV or Parquet file into the System Overview
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Features">
    Select which columns to include and set the time step
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Model">
    Choose architecture and define input/output relationships
  </Step>
  <Step title="Train">
    Start training and monitor progress in real-time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze">
    View loss curves, test predictions, and download your model
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Account Settings

Access settings via the profile icon in the top right:

- **API Keys**: Generate keys for SDK authentication
- **Team Management**: Invite collaborators (enterprise plans)
- **Usage**: View training credits and storage
