## Controls and Simulation Focus

Onyx is purpose-built for controls and simulation engineers who need AI models that:

- **Predict system dynamics** - Model continuous hardware physics like acceleration/torque
- **Use hardware sensor data** - Drop in about ~1 hour of time series data (~10Hz+ sampling rate)
- **Run fast inference** - Deploy for real-time simulation and embedded systems at 1kHz+
- **Simulate trajectories** - Our models add a `simulate()` method to industry standard model libraries (eg. PyTorch) for multi-step trajectories with automatic state management
- **Can be verified** - By training small, fast models, we can verify the model's full input-output behavior before deployment for reliability and safety

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Data">
    Collect timeseries data from your hardware system with states, outputs, and control inputs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Features">
    Specify which features are model outputs and which are inputs, including state relationships
  </Step>
  <Step title="Train a Model">
    Use the cloud platform to train models with GPU acceleration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Simulate">
    Load your trained model and simulate trajectories for control and analysis
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Example

```python
from onyxengine import Onyx
from onyxengine.modeling import Input, Output, MLPConfig, TrainingConfig

# Initialize the client (uses ONYX_API_KEY env var)
onyx = Onyx()

# Define model structure
outputs = [Output(name='acceleration')]
inputs = [
    Input(name='velocity', parent='acceleration', relation='derivative'),
    Input(name='position', parent='velocity', relation='derivative'),
    Input(name='control_input'),
]

# Configure and train
model_config = MLPConfig(outputs=outputs, inputs=inputs, dt=0.01)
onyx.train_model(
    model_name='my_model',
    model_config=model_config,
    dataset_name='my_dataset',
)

# Load and simulate
model = onyx.load_model('my_model')
result = model.simulate(
    x0={'velocity': v0, 'position': p0},
    external_inputs={'control_input': u},
    sim_steps=100
)
```
