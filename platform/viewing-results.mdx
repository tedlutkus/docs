After training completes, the Onyx Engine platform provides tools to analyze results, compare models, and download trained weights.

## Jobs Tab

The Jobs tab shows all training and optimization jobs:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/jobs.png" alt="Jobs tab showing training history" />
</Frame>

Each job displays:
- **Status**: Queued, Running, Completed, Failed
- **Model name**: Target model for this job
- **Dataset**: Source training data
- **Progress**: Iterations completed
- **Metrics**: Final loss values

## Model Details

Click on a model to view detailed information:

</Frame>

### Overview

- **Configuration**: Architecture, hyperparameters, features
- **Training history**: Loss curves over iterations
- **Source dataset**: Which data trained this model

### Versions

Each training run creates a new model version. The platform tracks:
- Version ID
- Training date
- Final metrics
- Configuration differences

### Test Predictions

Visualize model predictions on test data:

- **Ground truth**: Actual values from dataset
- **Predictions**: Model outputs
- **Error**: Difference between predicted and actual

## Lineage Tracking

View the complete data-to-model lineage:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/lineage.png" alt="Data lineage visualization" />
</Frame>

The lineage view shows:
- Which raw datasets were processed
- Which training datasets were created
- Which models were trained from each dataset
- Version history for each object

## Comparing Models

To compare multiple models:

1. Select models from the Table view
2. Click "Compare"
3. View side-by-side metrics and configurations

Comparison shows:
- Architecture differences
- Hyperparameter differences
- Loss curve overlays
- Final metric comparison

## Downloading Models

### Via Platform

1. Navigate to the model
2. Click "Download"
3. Save the `.pt` file locally

### Via SDK

```python
from onyxengine import Onyx

# Initialize the client
onyx = Onyx()

# Download latest version
model = onyx.load_model('my_model')

# Download specific version
model = onyx.load_model('my_model', version_id='abc123...')

# Model is cached locally at ~/.onyx/models/
```

## Understanding Metrics

### Single-Step Loss

- Measures one-step prediction accuracy
- Lower is better
- Good baseline metric for model quality

### Multi-Step Loss

- Measures trajectory simulation accuracy
- More relevant for deployment
- Sensitive to error accumulation

### Interpreting Values

| Loss Range | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| < 0.001 | Excellent fit |
| 0.001 - 0.01 | Good fit |
| 0.01 - 0.1 | Moderate fit, may need improvement |
| > 0.1 | Poor fit, check configuration |

<Note>
Loss values are relative to your data. Compare across models trained on the same dataset.
</Note>

## Optimization Results

For optimization jobs, additional information is available:

### Trial Comparison

- Each trial's configuration
- Metrics for each trial
- Best trial identification

### Hyperparameter Analysis

- Which parameters had the biggest impact
- Correlation between parameters and performance
- Recommended configurations

## Managing Versions

### Setting Default Version

1. Navigate to the model
2. Go to Versions tab
3. Click "Set as Default" on your preferred version

The default version is returned by `load_model()` without a version ID.

### Deleting Versions

1. Navigate to the model version
2. Click "Delete"
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
Deleted versions cannot be recovered. Downloaded copies remain valid.
</Warning>

## Exporting Results

### Export Metrics

Download training metrics as CSV:
- Loss history
- Learning rate schedule
- Validation metrics

### Export Configuration

Download model configuration as JSON:
- Architecture parameters
- Feature definitions
- Training settings
